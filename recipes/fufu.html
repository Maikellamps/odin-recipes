    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Ghanaian fufu is a mixture of boiled cassava, plantains, and butter.</p>
    <p>It's often served with hot groundnut soup ladled over top.</p> 
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 yucca (cassava) roots, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>5 medium yellow plantains, with peels on</li>
        <li>Â½ cup butter, or more as needed </li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Place cassava and unpeeled plantains into a large pot.
            Fill with enough water to cover and bring to a boil. 
            Cook until cassava is soft, about 30 minutes; drain. </li>

        <li>Remove and discard plantain peels from plantains.</li>

        <li>Mash cassava and plantains with butter, then beat with an electric mixer until smooth.</li>
        <li>Use as much butter as needed to get the mixture moist enough to blend.</li>
